# Consider the MNIST handwritten dataset. Let us now look at how a Neural network can be used to classify this data. 

# The MNIST dataset can be downloaded here.

# The below code demonstrates the usage of MLPClassifier in sklearn.neural_network that helps us create a classifier using a neural network.

# Reading the data

# Train data contains digit data and the correct labels
# Test data contains just the digit data and no labels 
mnist_train = pd.read_csv("datasets/mnist/train.csv")
mnist_test = pd.read_csv("datasets/mnist/test.csv")
# Let's visualize the image represented by the first rows of the train data and the test data
train_data_digit1 = np.asarray(mnist_train.iloc[0:1,1:]).reshape(28,28)
test_data_digit1 = np.asarray(mnist_test.iloc[0:1,]).reshape(28,28)
plt.subplot(1,2,1)
plt.imshow(train_data_digit1,cmap = plt.cm.gray_r)
plt.title("First digit in train data")
plt.subplot(1,2,2)
plt.imshow(test_data_digit1,cmap = plt.cm.gray_r)
plt.title("First digit in test data ")
This code snippet processes and visualizes handwritten digit images from the MNIST dataset using Python with pandas, numpy, and matplotlib libraries. Here's a summary:

Data Loading:
Loads MNIST training data (mnist_train) from a CSV file, which includes digit data (pixel values) and corresponding labels.
Loads MNIST test data (mnist_test) from a CSV file, which contains only digit data without labels.
Data Preparation:
Extracts the first row of pixel data from mnist_train (excluding the label column) and reshapes it into a 28x28 array (train_data_digit1) to represent a digit image.
Extracts the first row of pixel data from mnist_test and reshapes it into a 28x28 array (test_data_digit1) to represent a digit image.
Visualization:
Creates a subplot with two panels (1 row, 2 columns).
Displays the first training digit image in the left panel using plt.imshow with a grayscale colormap (plt.cm.gray_r), titled "First digit in train data".
Displays the first test digit image in the right panel using plt.imshow with the same grayscale colormap, titled "First digit in test data".
Purpose: The code visualizes the first digit images from both the training and test sets of the MNIST dataset side by side for comparison, likely to inspect the data visually.

Potential Notes:

The code assumes the CSV files are structured with pixel values in columns (784 columns for 28x28 images) and, for the training data, a label column as the first column.
No labels are used in the visualization, so the actual digit values (e.g., 0-9) are not indicated.
The code relies on libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot) being imported, though the import statements are not shown.
