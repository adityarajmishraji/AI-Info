# Consider the MNIST handwritten dataset. Let us now look at how a Neural network can be used to classify this data. 

# The MNIST dataset can be downloaded here.

# The below code demonstrates the usage of MLPClassifier in sklearn.neural_network that helps us create a classifier using a neural network.

# Reading the data

# Train data contains digit data and the correct labels
# Test data contains just the digit data and no labels 
mnist_train = pd.read_csv("datasets/mnist/train.csv")
mnist_test = pd.read_csv("datasets/mnist/test.csv")
# Let's visualize the image represented by the first rows of the train data and the test data
train_data_digit1 = np.asarray(mnist_train.iloc[0:1,1:]).reshape(28,28)
test_data_digit1 = np.asarray(mnist_test.iloc[0:1,]).reshape(28,28)
plt.subplot(1,2,1)
plt.imshow(train_data_digit1,cmap = plt.cm.gray_r)
plt.title("First digit in train data")
plt.subplot(1,2,2)
plt.imshow(test_data_digit1,cmap = plt.cm.gray_r)
plt.title("First digit in test data ")
This code snippet processes and visualizes handwritten digit images from the MNIST dataset using Python with pandas, numpy, and matplotlib libraries. Here's a summary:

Data Loading:
Loads MNIST training data (mnist_train) from a CSV file, which includes digit data (pixel values) and corresponding labels.
Loads MNIST test data (mnist_test) from a CSV file, which contains only digit data without labels.
Data Preparation:
Extracts the first row of pixel data from mnist_train (excluding the label column) and reshapes it into a 28x28 array (train_data_digit1) to represent a digit image.
Extracts the first row of pixel data from mnist_test and reshapes it into a 28x28 array (test_data_digit1) to represent a digit image.
Visualization:
Creates a subplot with two panels (1 row, 2 columns).
Displays the first training digit image in the left panel using plt.imshow with a grayscale colormap (plt.cm.gray_r), titled "First digit in train data".
Displays the first test digit image in the right panel using plt.imshow with the same grayscale colormap, titled "First digit in test data".
Purpose: The code visualizes the first digit images from both the training and test sets of the MNIST dataset side by side for comparison, likely to inspect the data visually.

Potential Notes:

The code assumes the CSV files are structured with pixel values in columns (784 columns for 28x28 images) and, for the training data, a label column as the first column.
No labels are used in the visualization, so the actual digit values (e.g., 0-9) are not indicated.
The code relies on libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot) being imported, though the import statements are not shown.

  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'mnist_train' is not defined
Breakdown:

Objective: Split the training dataset (mnist_train) into features (X_train) and labels (Y_train).
Details:
mnist_train: A pandas DataFrame containing the MNIST training data, where:
The first column (index 0) holds the labels (digits 0–9).
The remaining columns (index 1 onward) hold the 784 pixel values (for 28x28 images).
X_train = mnist_train.iloc[:,1:]:
iloc[:,1:] selects all rows (:) and all columns starting from index 1 (excluding the label column).
X_train is a DataFrame containing the pixel values (features) for each training image (shape: number of samples × 784).
Y_train = mnist_train.iloc[:,0:1]:
iloc[:,0:1] selects all rows and only the first column (label column).
Y_train is a DataFrame containing the labels (shape: number of samples × 1).
Note: Using 0:1 keeps Y_train as a DataFrame. Alternatively, mnist_train.iloc[:,0] would yield a Series.
Purpose: This step ensures the features (X_train) and labels (Y_train) are separated for supervised learning, where X_train is the input to the model, and Y_train is the target output.
Potential Notes:

The code assumes mnist_train is a pandas DataFrame loaded from a CSV with the structure described (label in the first column, pixels in the rest).
No preprocessing (e.g., normalization of pixel values) is performed here, though it’s common in MNIST tasks to scale pixel values (0–255) to [0,1] for better neural network performance.

This section builds, trains, and uses a neural network to classify digits using scikit-learn’s MLPClassifier.

# [2]
Unable to run code at the moment
Breakdown:

Importing the Classifier:
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier: Imports the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier from scikit-learn, a simple feedforward neural network for classification tasks.
Model Initialization:
nn_model = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(50)):
Creates an MLPClassifier instance with a single hidden layer containing 50 neurons.
hidden_layer_sizes=(50): Specifies the architecture of the hidden layers. Here, it’s a tuple with one element (50), meaning one hidden layer with 50 nodes.
Default parameters (not specified) include:
Activation function: ReLU (relu).
Solver: Adam (adam).
Learning rate: Constant with default value 0.001.
Maximum iterations: 200.
Random state: None (results may vary slightly across runs).
The input layer size is automatically set to 784 (number of features in X_train), and the output layer size is 10 (one for each digit, 0–9).
Model Training:
nn_model.fit(X_train, mnist_train.iloc[:,0]):
Trains the neural network using X_train (pixel values) and mnist_train.iloc[:,0] (labels).
mnist_train.iloc[:,0]: Extracts the label column as a Series (not a DataFrame like Y_train), containing the target digits (0–9).
Note: Using mnist_train.iloc[:,0] instead of Y_train is slightly inconsistent, as Y_train was defined earlier. However, both represent the same labels, and MLPClassifier accepts either a Series or a 1D array for labels.
The fit method adjusts the model’s weights to minimize classification error on the training data using backpropagation and the Adam optimizer.
Prediction:
nn_model.predict(mnist_test.iloc[0:1,]):
Uses the trained model to predict the digit class for the first test sample.
mnist_test.iloc[0:1,] selects the first row of the test data (all columns, which are the 784 pixel values, as mnist_test has no label column).
The output [2] indicates the model predicts the first test digit as the number 2.
print(...): Outputs the prediction result ([2]).
Purpose: This section builds a simple neural network to learn digit classification from the MNIST training data and demonstrates its use by predicting the class of the first test image.

Potential Notes:

Model Simplicity: A single hidden layer with 50 nodes is relatively small for MNIST, which often benefits from deeper networks or more nodes for higher accuracy (e.g., 98–99% accuracy with optimized models vs. ~90–95% here).
No Preprocessing: Pixel values are likely in the range 0–255, but MLPClassifier can handle unnormalized data, though normalization (e.g., dividing by 255) often improves convergence and accuracy.
No Evaluation: The code doesn’t evaluate model performance (e.g., accuracy on a validation set), so it’s unclear how well the model generalizes.
Test Data: The prediction assumes mnist_test has the same 784-column structure as X_train. Since mnist_test has no labels, the true digit for the predicted [2] cannot be verified here.
Output Interpretation: The output [2] is an array because predict returns an array of predictions. For a single sample, it’s a single-element array.
Default Parameters: The model uses scikit-learn’s defaults, which may not be optimal for MNIST. For example, tweaking max_iter, learning_rate, or adding more hidden layers could improve results.
Summary
Feature Engineering:
Splits mnist_train into X_train (pixel values) and Y_train (labels) for supervised learning.
Simple and straightforward, with no additional preprocessing.
Building an Artificial Neural Network:
Uses scikit-learn’s MLPClassifier to create a neural network with one hidden layer (50 nodes).
Trains the model on X_train and labels.
Predicts the class of the first test sample, outputting [2].
Overall: The code demonstrates a basic pipeline for training a neural network on MNIST and making a prediction, but it’s minimalistic (no preprocessing, evaluation, or hyperparameter tuning).
